## Hi there 👋

Retail & Finance Analytics | Commercial Insight | Data Storytelling

I work with messy transactional data and turn it into clear commercial decisions.
My focus is on pricing, demand, customer behaviour, and performance diagnostics in retail and payments.

### What I work on
- Retail sales analysis (price vs volume, mix, demand risk)
- Payments & transaction behaviour (M-Pesa, micro-transactions, revenue drivers)
- Exploratory analysis with commercial narratives, not dashboards-for-the-sake-of-it

### Tools
Python · R · SQL · PowerBI · Excel
